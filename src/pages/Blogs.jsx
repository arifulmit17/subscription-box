                        <p>At Netflix, we use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our cloud infrastructure needs, such as compute, storage, and networking to build and run the streaming platform that we love. Our ecosystem enables engineering teams to run applications and services at scale, utilizing a mix of open-source and proprietary solutions. In turn, our self-serve platforms allow teams to create and deploy, sometimes custom, workloads more efficiently. This diverse technological landscape generates extensive and rich data from various infrastructure entities, from which, data engineers and analysts collaborate to provide actionable insights to the engineering organization in a continuous feedback loop that ultimately enhances the business.
                        One crucial way in which we do this is through the democratization of highly curated data sources that sunshine usage and cost patterns across Netflixâ€™s services and teams. The Data & Insights organization partners closely with our engineering teams to share key efficiency metrics, empowering internal stakeholders to make informed business decisions.
